Questions that strikes curiosity - 

what are Browsers ? 
Well browsers are piece of software that provides communication from one computer to another computer , basically a server is also a computer right , and if we go to chrome and search www.google.com it will take us to the website . 

Behind the scene what is happening is in the next Question 



How do they render websites ? 
The server or the Big boi computer sends a html css and js files to our computer , and the browser translates or in english term renders the file and gives us the output that we see , which is 
the website . 

For Now we dont have to think how the html is coming how the css is coming how the js is coming from that of the server , 
We need to just know what it is doing . 


What is the purpose to do html css and Js ? 
html - very minimal , 
css - minimal 
js - Heavy 

3 foundations so all time it is needed .
